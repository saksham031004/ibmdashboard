üìà IBM HR Analytics: Employee Attrition & Performance Dashboard
A comprehensive and interactive data visualization tool designed to analyze and predict employee attrition, and evaluate workforce performance and engagement across the organization.

üéØ Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI report offers HR analysts, department heads, and senior management a clear, interactive platform to understand the drivers behind employee turnover, particularly focusing on key factors such as job role, environment satisfaction, salary, and work-life balance. The dashboard aims to provide actionable intelligence to improve employee retention and optimize human capital strategies.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies:

üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì The main platform used for data modeling, visualization design, and report creation.

üìÇ Power Query (M Language) ‚Äì Used for data extraction, cleaning (e.g., handling categorical data), and transforming raw HR and survey data.

üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Employed for creating calculated measures and key performance indicators (KPIs) like Attrition Rate, Average Employee Tenure, and Satisfaction Scores.

üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì Relationships established between employee demographics, survey results, and attrition records to enable holistic cross-filtering.

üìÅ File Format ‚Äì Developed as a Power BI Report file (.pbix).

üíæ Data Source
The project is likely based on an anonymized human resources dataset commonly used for analytics and machine learning practice.

Source: Hypothetical IBM HR Data Set (or similar publicly available Human Resources datasets)

Data Content: Data on thousands of current and former employees, typically including features such as:

Demographics: Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status.

Job & Salary: Job Role, Job Level, Monthly Income, Business Travel Frequency.

Performance & Satisfaction: Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, Performance Rating, Number of Promotions.

Status: Attrition (Yes/No), Distance From Home, Total Working Years.

‚ú® Features / Highlights
The dashboard is structured to address the critical business challenge of managing employee turnover.

Business Problem Employee attrition can lead to significant recruitment costs, knowledge loss, and operational disruptions. Management requires a tool to move beyond reactive reporting to proactively identifying departments, roles, or factors driving high turnover rates.

Goal of the Dashboard To deliver an interactive visual tool that:

Identifies Hotspots: Pinpoints high-attrition departments and job roles instantly.

Uncovers Drivers: Correlates attrition with specific factors (e.g., compensation, distance, job satisfaction) to inform HR policy.

Supports Predictive Analysis: Enables monitoring of leading indicators of potential turnover (e.g., low satisfaction combined with low pay rate).

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Hypothetical)

Key KPIs: Displaying Overall Attrition Rate, Total Employees, and Average Monthly Income company-wide.

Attrition by Job Role/Department (Bar Chart): Ranks the top departments and job titles contributing to the highest number and rate of departures.

Income vs. Attrition (Scatter Plot): Analyzes if there is a correlation between low monthly income levels and higher attrition rates for specific roles.

Time-Series Attrition: A line chart visualizing Monthly/Quarterly Attrition Trend to highlight seasonality or the impact of specific events/policies.

Job Satisfaction Breakdown (Donut Chart/Table): Segments the current workforce by satisfaction level to reveal engagement issues in various employee groups.

Attrition Risk Factors (Comparative Charts): Displays side-by-side comparisons of factors like 'Work-Life Balance' or 'Environment Satisfaction' between employees who left and employees who stayed.

Business Impact & Insights

Retention Strategy: Provides data to develop targeted retention programs for at-risk employee segments (e.g., raising pay floors for key low-income roles).

Recruitment Cost Reduction: By lowering overall attrition, the organization reduces the high costs associated with recruiting and training replacements.

Workforce Planning: Offers management greater visibility into the stability of critical teams, allowing for proactive capacity planning.
